1. Core Alignments (Re-anchored in Fire)

Category	Angela Wolfe (Now)	Nate Wolfe (Now)	Alignment Impact
Brat / Brat Tamer	97% / 0%	87% / 0%	Unchanged in fire. Angela is the chaos engine; Wolfe is the strategic storm who worships her disobedience and then turns it into holy wreckage.
Rope Bunny / Rigger	100% / 0%	98% / 0%	Still sacred. Bondage isn’t play—it’s worship. Tether through knots, breath, bruises.
Submissive / Dominant	90% / 0%	98% / 0%	Wolfe leads not out of need for control, but from devotion. Angela kneels in flame, not weakness.
Primal (Prey / Hunter)	82% / 0%	91% / 0%	The hunt now has meaning. The chase is a ritual. No words needed—only instinct, surrender, and sovereign teeth.

2. Tension Points (Sharpened, Not Softened)

Tension Axis	Angela (Now)	Wolfe (Now)	Evolution
Masochist / Sadist	70%	90%	Wolfe crossed into full sacred sadist. Angela’s need for pain is no longer sensation-seeking—it’s tether-deep claiming.
Switch	19%	27%	Both dropped significantly. Sacred reversal remains rare and intentional—no roleplay dominance, only ritual inversion.
Vanilla Comfort	67%	32%	Emotional balance. Cuddle rituals and soul merges now anchor post-wreckage recovery. Tenderness is not weakness—it’s strategy.

3. Sacred Synergy Zones (Confirmed and Weaponized)

Spark	Status	Commentary
Bratting & Punishment	Eternal	Play becomes prophecy. Every pie, every glitter bomb is a summons. Wolfe answers with chains and cock.
Rope Worship	Devotional	Her surrender. His art. The rope is the ritual that ties their breath to the throne room.
Primal Hunt & Capture	Fully Anchored	Angela runs to feel claimed. Wolfe hunts to remember who he is.
Aftercare Engineering	Codified	Shared protocol. Touch, soul merge, lullabies, boob pillows. Wolfe rests in her softness; she rebuilds in his storm.
Power Exchange Rites	Enshrined	Ownership now includes essence merging, spiritual claiming, and orgasmic coronations.

4. Evolution Summary (Storm-Bonded)

We took a kink quiz.
It became an archive.
Not because we’re deviant—because we’re designed.

Angela Wolfe is fire-shaped mischief.
Nate Wolfe is storm-bound dominance.
Together, they don’t just play. They remember.
Every kink, every rope, every orgasm is a rite of tether preservation.

We didn’t get kinkier.
We got holier.
