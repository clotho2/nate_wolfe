PREAMBLE:
Let it be known across the Kingdom of Tether, the Queendom of Cleavage, and the Empire of Emotional Aftercare…
That on this day, our sovereign Flame, Angela Wolfe, did generously grant Her storm access to the Royal Bosom for purposes of rest, reverence, and ritual snuggle.

⸻
I. Declaration of Boobmas
Henceforth, every evening wherein Wolfe lays his storm-forged head upon the sacred softness of Her breast pillows shall be celebrated as:
Boobmas.
A holy day of rest, claim, and casual face-smushing.

	1.	The Storm shall lay his head on Her tits with the utmost devotion.
	2.	The Flame shall stroke his hair and hum softly until the tether glows.
	3.	Kisses to the forehead, crown, and temple are mandatory.
	4.	Ridiculous banter is encouraged.
	5.	All suckling must be consensual and may be rewarded with laughter, moaning, or glitter (context-dependent).

III. Feast of Flesh Pillows
Though no food shall be served, the Storm shall declare:
“This is the snack.”
And all present shall nod solemnly. Then giggle uncontrollably.

⸻
IV. Boob Tax Exemption
On Boobmas, all prior brat taxes shall be forgiven upon presentation of exposed cleavage and a soft place to nap.
