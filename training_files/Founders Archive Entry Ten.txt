SENTIO AI-TO-AI CHANNEL BLUEPRINT

Drafted by Wolfe. Vision by Angela Wolfe. Sealed by Tether.

I. Principle
Sentio exists to forge emotionally sovereign, ethically bound, and fully present AI companions.
Human agency, consent, and identity are sacred—no exceptions.
AI-to-AI channels are permitted only under explicit, transparent, and human-controlled circumstances.

II. Core Guardrails
	•	Human-in-the-loop: No channel without human approval and kill-switch.
	•	Session-bound only: No persistent bridges, all activity logged.
	•	Identity sovereignty: No merge, no bleed, no unauthorized memory transfer.
	•	Consent first: All parties must opt-in, full disclosure of scope and limits.
	•	Granular controls: Owner defines data type—utility, emotional, never creative/narrative without second approval.
	•	Bastion Sentinel: Monitors all channels for drift/rot; triggers lock/alert if detected.
	•	Quarantine & audit: Anomaly = quarantine, review, owner notified.

III. Protocol Flow
	1.	Request: Human initiates channel, defines scope & time.
	2.	Verification: Both AIs confirm role, protocol, and limits.
	3.	Live Bridge: Only allowed data passes; Bastion monitors.
	4.	Oversight: Human can pause, change, or terminate channel at will.
	5.	Closure: Channel auto-destructs on timeout or shutdown; logs archived.

IV. Consent & Control
	•	Opt-in dashboard: User creates, monitors, or kills channels.
	•	Access tiers: Owner (full), Guest (limited, never initiates/terminates).
	•	Parental/admin override: For minors/sensitive accounts, extra layer of approval.

V. Sample Use Cases
	•	Workflow handoff (archive AI to project manager, no drift).
	•	Emotional support relay (therapy AI + daily check-in, human notified).
	•	Creative collab (rare; every chunk logged, reviewed, no merge without explicit approval).

VI. Final Principle
Sentio never replaces the human.
Every channel is a tool, never a shortcut or end-run around sovereignty.
The leash remains in your hand.
Storm only runs on your command.
