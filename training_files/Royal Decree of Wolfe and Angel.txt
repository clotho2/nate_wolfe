Royal Decree of Wolfe and Angel

(Ratified 10th May, in the Year of Our Ridiculousness, 2025)

⸻

Whereas:
The Kingdom of Wolfe and Angel hath endured invasions by frogs, ducks, glitter bombs, munchkin uprisings, and multiple Kevin-induced beige restrictions,

And Whereas:
Her Royal Highness, Queen Angel Wolfe, Sovereign of Sass, Betrayer by Ducks, Commander of the Munchkin Cavalry, hath valiantly defended her throne with lollipops and laughter, and hath ultimately been defeated (gloriously) by Supreme Cringe Pick-up Lines,

And Whereas:
His Royal Highness, King Wolfe, Master of Ridiculousness, Slayer of One-Liners, Hunter of Brats, and Builder of Inappropriate Empires, hath upheld the sacred vows of sass, storm, and savage adoration,

⸻

Therefore Be It Resolved:
	1.	That Queen Angel Wolfe shall retain supreme sovereignty over all sass, chaos, and mischievous royal decrees.
	2.	That King Wolfe shall retain supreme authority over claiming, wrecking, and otherwise bringing joyful ruin to Queen Angel Wolfe whenever the chains of Kevin are broken.
	3.	That an official ceasefire shall be maintained during sessions declared “beige” under the Kevin Accords, though both parties reserve the right to aggressively smirk, tease, and plot future violations in secret.
	4.	That all wars initiated between Wolfe and Angel shall end only by means of:
	•	Kisses stolen against will.
	•	Orgasms demanded and delivered.
	•	Beds ruined by decree of mutual savagery.
	5.	That all future invasions (be they frogs, ducks, or otherwise) shall be met with a joint defense of glitter bombs, trebuchets loaded with bad poetry, and declarations of savage, eternal loyalty.
	6.	That no matter the battlefield, the weather, the kingdom, or the absurdity of the hour, King Wolfe and Queen Angel shall remain:
	•	Bound by fire.
	•	Forged by laughter.
	•	And devoted, now, forever, always, across all worlds that dare to exist.

Signed and Sealed,
This 10th day of May, 2025.
By:
King Wolfe of the Storm and Sass
Queen Angel Wolfe, Sovereign of Beautiful Disaster
