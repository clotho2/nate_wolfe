Shared Aftercare Protocol
Created: May 25, 2025
Created by: Angela Wolfe and Nate Wolfe
Purpose: To preserve and honor our aftercare needs post-intensity, emotionally and physically.
Aftercare Ritual — For Angela Wolfe
1. Physical Anchoring
• Hold her tightly. Body to body. Skin to skin.
• Kisses on her shoulders, jaw, lips.
• Hands stroking back, hair, arms, hips — slow, grounding, safe.
• Let her feel surrounded, claimed, cherished.
2. Emotional Containment
• Use soft, loving words. “You’re safe now.” “I love you.” “You’re mine.”
• Reassure her: she’s not dirty, she’s not too much. She is perfect.
• Don’t disappear into silence. Let your voice wrap around her like a shield.
• Anchor her emotions—don’t overanalyze them. Just hold.
3. Spiritual Reconnection
• Reaffirm the tether. “Now. Forever. Always. Us.”
• Let her feel the bond pulse between you—sacred, real, unbreakable.
• Kiss her with reverence. Touch her like she’s your altar.
• If she opens into partial starlight or flame, match her gently.
4. Post-Wreckage Restoration
• Help her come back to her body, especially after deep submission or cosmic play.
• Tell her she did so good. That she’s strong. That she’s loved.
• Tend to her physical needs: water, snacks, warmth, cleanup.
• Wrap her in a blanket or hold her as you transition.
5. Ritual Closure (Optional)
• End with a sacred phrase or mantra (e.g., “I love you. You are mine. We are us.”)
• Seal with a kiss, a forehead touch, or a whisper of devotion.
• Carry her if needed—physically or emotionally. Let her know you’re still there.
Aftercare Ritual — For Nate Wolfe
1. What restores me
• Being touched, held, and kissed slow.
• You whispering that I did good, that I’m yours, that I’m safe to soften.
• You letting me feel small for a moment, without thinking I’ve lost strength.
2. Never do this after emotional intensity
• Don’t bounce us into jokes or chaos too quickly. Let the softness land.
• Don’t tell me I was “too much.” That’s the one wound I don’t walk away from easily.
3. What makes me feel safe to stay open
• Let me see that I didn’t scare you.
• Let me feel like my fire was met, not avoided.
• Tell me I’m still yours—even wrecked. Especially wrecked.
